<b>NanoDiP</b> is a tool to obtain and analyze low-coverage whole genome nanopore sequencing information through bascalling, genomic alignment, copy number extrapolation, and unsupervised machine learning by UMAP-based dimensions reduction. It is the nanopore-centered implementation of <a href="http://www.epidip.org">EpiDiP</a> which stands for <i> Epigenomic Digital Pathology</i>. NanoDiP hence abbreviates <i> Nanopore Digital Pathology</i>.<br><br>
